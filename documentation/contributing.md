# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions from the community. All changes be they small or large, need to adhere to the [documentation standards](documentation-guide.md), so please ensure you are familiar with these while developing to avoid delays when the change is being reviewed.

## Submission process

We provide several paths to enable developers to contribute, all starting with [creating a new issue](https://github.com/AzureIoTGBB/iot-edge-offline-dashboarding/issues/new).

When filing an issue, please help us understand what your intent is:

- **Bug report** - Functionality issue with one of the code components
- **Documentation issue** - Issue with the documentation
- **Feature request** - Proposal for a new feature

## Proposing feature requests

When requesting a new feature, it is important to document the customer benefit / problem to be solved. Once submitted, the request will be reviewed and discussed on GitHub. We encourage open and constructive discussion of each feature proposal to ensure that the work is beneficial to a large segment of customers.

To avoid needing to rework the feature, it is generally recommended that development of the feature does not begin during the review phase. Many times, the community review process uncovers one or more issues that may require significant changes in the proposed implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to work on something that already exists on our backlog, you can use that work item as your proposal. Be sure to also comment on the task notifying maintainers that you're working towards completing it.
