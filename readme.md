# IoT Edge Offline Dashboarding

This project provides a set of modules that can be used with Azure IoT Edge in order to perform dashboarding at the edge.  There are two major points this project addresses:

* Give local machine operators the ability to view telemetry and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) during intermittent or offline internet connection scenarios.
* View near real-time telemetry and KPIs without the latency of telemetry data traveling to the cloud first.

The architecture for this solution is composed of the following components:

* [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/)
* [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)
* [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/)
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/)

For information on why this architecture was chosen and discussion of alternatives, please see [background](background.md).
