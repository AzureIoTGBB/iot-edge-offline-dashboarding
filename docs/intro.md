# Business Need

Smart Manufacturing provides new opportunities to improve inefficiencies across labor, processes, machinery, materials and energy across manufacturing lifecycle. 

Azure Industrial IoT provides hybrid-cloud based components to build the end to end industrial IoT platform to enable innovation and to optimize operational processes.

Most manufacturers start their journey by providing visibility across machines, processes, lines, factories through their unified industrial IoT platform. This is achieved by collecting data from manufacturing processes to provide end to end visibility.

Different stakeholders will then make use of that platform to cater their own needs e.g planning department doing global planning engineers monitoring and fine-tuning production phases. 

Operators and users that are responsible for monitoring of operations are at the top of industrial IoT stakeholders list. They are usually responsible for well-being of operations and processes and need to have access to information in real-time. On the other hand, we also know that means of communication (infrastructure) is less than perfect in many manufacturing facilities. Although, we can provide real time access in the industrial IoT platform, what would happen if communications to cloud is cut-off? In terms of data reliability, Azure IoT Edge ensures data is accumulated when communications to cloud is broken and sent to the industrial IoT platform when facility is restored. But how can users access real time information in the meanwhile?
